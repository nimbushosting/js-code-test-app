# JavaScript App Code Test

An application designed to test applicant coding abilities

Basics
You should follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub Repository (priviate or public, up to you)
2. Create a Vue application that will retrieve data from [](https://docs.trending-github.com/)
3. Retrieve a list of trending repositories from `https://api.trending-github.com
/github/repositories`.
4. Display each repository in table using Vue.js - Display the name, programming language, star count, fork count and authors avatar.
5. Allow the star count and fork count columns to be sorted.
6. Display the first 10 languages in a list from `https://api.trending-github.com/github/languages` 
7. Push all changes to your repository

Extra credit
1. Use TailwindCSS to style your pages
2. Store the data in localStorage and retrieve from localStorage, so that the request doesn't have to be made every time the page is refreshed.
3. Table should be responsive and only show name and star count when being viewed on a small device
4. Allow users to search all programming languages that are returned from: `https://api.trending-github.com/github/languages`

Once completed, please provide the repo link (or invite Nimbus Hosting) for review

Good Luck.
